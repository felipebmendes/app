1. tenant and organization are set as github secrets. we could have a config file to this,
3. I manually add a "appName" key to the manifest "docker" key in the manifest. We could add this in the config file.
4. we are creating the task and finishing the action, we should keep the action running until the and, maybe even add
logs for that. since carol has the logs.

Question:
* Should we create a new release in carol too after the build? Carol version is not necessarily the same as the git.
* I made bumpversion to bump the tag version inside the manifest file.
 if I have more then one image it will change both
